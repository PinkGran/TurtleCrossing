# TurtleCrossing

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of creating a game resembling crossy roads but implemented using the turtle module in Python. The game has a green colored turtle that attempts to reach the opposite side of the road while avoiding the cars. Each of the cars are also "turtles" but in the shape of rectangles and they are randomly generated. Once the turtle reaches the opposite side, the player levels up and the speed of the cars increases. This process continues until a car hits the turtle.
